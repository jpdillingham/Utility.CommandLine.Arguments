# How to Contribute

1. Create an issue
   - Clearly state your problem or idea
   - If you'd like to contribute code, state how you intend to solve the problem
   - For the best chance of having your code merged, wait until I've responded.
2. Fork the repo
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a Pull Request

## Rules

- Test coverage must remain 100% unless you have a _really_ good reason.
- Use the analysis ruleset included in the repo.  Your code must be free of rule violations from analyzers, including StyleCop.
- All code must reside in Arguments.cs.  This allows users to include the library in their project as source without creating clutter.
- Follow existing conventions.  This includes code and documentation. 
- Tread lightly.  Sweeping changes are not likely to be merged.
